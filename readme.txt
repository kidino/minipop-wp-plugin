Minipop Pop-up is a small plugin that displays an image as pop-up on your homepage with the lightbox effect. Supports desktop and mobile screens.

== Description ==
Minipop is intended to be a simple plugin that allows you to have an image as pop-up on your homepage. You can upload or select two images, one of desktop and the other for mobile screens. You can also toggle to turn it on or off. That\'s it. 

== Installation ==
From your WordPress installation, navigate to Plugin and click on the \"Add New Plugin\" button. In the search field type “Minipop Pop-up,” then click “Search Plugins.” Once you’ve found it, you can view the plugin details such as the point release, rating, and description. Install it by clicking “Install Now,” and WordPress will take it from there.
